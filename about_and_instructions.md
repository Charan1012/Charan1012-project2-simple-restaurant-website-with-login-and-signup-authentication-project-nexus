I have created a simple restaurant login and signup with authentication

This project is the second project gien to me in the internship at NEXUs 

for front end I used reactjs and redux 
for the backend I used nodejs with express frame work
for database I used mongodb atlas -a cloud database for storing the user signup details for login purpose


for authentication I used JWT(java web token) .It provides security for the login purpose.
for this i used bcryptjs in my authentication purpose.

In server directory I used nodemon .so start with the command "npm start" to start the backend.
In the fron end I used crreate-react-app for implementing reactjs in my project. so use the command "npm start" to run the frontend.

Also remainder - I deleted nodemodules before uploading to my git repository .so in both user and server directories download node modules before using my project work.

Thank you.
